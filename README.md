# About
A clone of [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) made in the Godot Engine.

Made to get some practice with Godot's Control nodes. (Also some Model and View code separation)

# Currently implemented
- 2048 gameplay (can get to 2048)
- Can start a new game (during current session/after game over/after winning)
- Display of current score and a local record of best score
- Nice animations for the tiles
- Resizable to fit on different display sizes (Hopefully)

# Future improvements
- Save and reload ongoing game on start
- UI sounds and tile movement sound
- Touchscreen controls
- Settings screen (reset progress, animation speed/on/off, volume control)
- Export/Import saves?
